# Explore the Kepler Exoplanets
Lighthouse Labs final project: Data visualization of the Kepler system using threeJS and Django.

## About

You may be wondering why there are two apps here. The answer? We are ambitious. Django was great for getting us started and connecting us with the Kplr API. The project, however, is best as a single page app that loads quickly from JSON.

## Versions

The Django version is [located here](https://github.com/lkhedlund/explore-exoplanets/tree/master/kepler_exoplanets).

The single page version is [located here](https://github.com/lkhedlund/explore-exoplanets/tree/master/kepler_js).

## Which should I choose?

Both are great, and have their strengths and weaknesses. This project is mostly a demo, though, rather than a full production app, so either is good.

## Can I use this code?

Absolutely! We want you to find value in what we've produced, so feel free to download the code, or bits of it, and have fun with it!

## Enjoy! From Anita, Fabien, Jennifer, and Lars
