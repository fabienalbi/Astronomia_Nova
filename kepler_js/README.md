# Explore the Kepler Exoplanets (In Development)
Lighthouse Labs final project: Data visualization of the Kepler system using threeJS and some JavaScript magic.

## Getting started
This one is pretty straightforward. Just download the code, navigate to the _kepler_js_ folder on your computer, and run `python -m http.server` or `python3 -m http.server`. You'll need Python version 3.x, which is pretty standard these days. You can also run it with your favourite local server of choice.
